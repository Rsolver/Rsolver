/><p>Hi , my name is Cubastic and today I will teach you how to solve a 3x3
Rubik's cube. The technique I'm about to show you is really easy and
absolutely everyone can learn it. I can guarantee that after watching all 4
parts of this tutorial you will easily solve a Rubik's cube no matter how
scrambled it is. And if you already know how to solve a Rubik's cube this
method will be really useful because with it you'll be able to teach your
friends, your parents, your siblings or classmates. Let's go. First, let's
learn what the Rubik's cube consists of. It has 6 faces and therefore 6
colours. White, yellow, green, blue, red and orange. It's really important to
remember that white will always be opposite yellow, blue opposite green and
red opposite orange. That is due to the Rubik's cube structure. And no matter
how you turn or scramble it - white center piece will always be opposite
yellow, blue opposite green and red opposite orange. It's also really
important to know that a Rubik's cube has 3 layers. To determine which layer
is which just pick up the Rubik's cube and the lowest layer will be called the
first layer. The top layer is called the third layer and middle one is the
second layer. So, again-the first layer, the second layer and the third layer.
Don't confuse layers with faces. Now let's diassemble the Rubik's cube and see
what elements it has. There are three types of elements and the first one is
the central axis. As you can see all center pieces are fixed and they cannot
move relative to another. The center piece has only one color. We also have
the edge pieces, which have two colours, like this one for example has red and
white. This is what it looks like inside the cube. And the corner elements,
like this one for example, they have three colours, this one has blue, white
and red and this is, again, what it looks like inside a cube. It's really
important to learn the pieces and not to confue them witheach other, I will be
calling them by their names and so should you. Now, when we know what the
Rubik's cube consists of let's move on to the turns. The sides of a cube could
be turned in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. There are 6 sides and
there are labels for turning each of them. Turning right side clockwise is
labeled with letter R. The apostrophe means &lt;&lt;prime&gt;&gt; and it means
turning counterclockwise, like R prime. And the same goes with the left face.
Left clockwise is L and left counterclockwise is L'. Front face clockwise turn
is labeled with letter F, and counterclockwise turn is F,. The sie can be
turned twice and when that happens the letter has number 2 next to it. For
example U or the up face 2. U2 means turning the up face two times. And it
doesn't matter which direction you're going, the result will always be he
same. So in this method you'll use only four sides. Right-R and R', Left-l and
L', Front-F and F', and Up-U and U'. Let'sa have a little practice. Take a
solved Rubik's cube in front of you and do the following combination: R which
is right face clockwise, U which is up face clockwise, and then do the
opposite R' or right face counterclockwise and U' which is up face
counterclockwise. These four moves will be the main moves of this whole
solving method. It's hard to beleive, but the only thing you'll need to do in order to solve a Rubik's cube is to learn these four moves. Let's practice a bit more. R, U, R', U'. Again. R, U, R', U'. To get more comfortable hod the cube the correct way: put three fingers on the top of the right side, on these three pieces, then it will be much easier to turn: Right, Up, Right counterclockwise, Up counterclockwise. After repeating this combo six times you'll return the cube to it's originaal position. So you know all the necessary info to start solving the Rubik's cube. Now you know what this puzzle consists of, how it works and how to turn it's sides. Now </p><br /><h1>Description</h1><p>In this video you have learnt the first part of
